Answer the following questions for each of the data structures you implemented as part of this project.

## Queue

1. What is the runtime complexity of `enqueue`?

O(1)

2. What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?

O(n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of `len`?

O(1)

## Binary Search Tree

1. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`? 

O(log n) on average; O(n) at worst.

2. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?

O(log n) on average; O(n) at worst.

3. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`? 

O(log n) on average; O(n) at worst.

## Heap

1. What is the runtime complexity of `_bubble_up`?

O(log n)

2. What is the runtime complexity of `_sift_down`?

O(log n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?

O(log n), because it calls `_bubble_up()`

4. What is the runtime complexity of `delete`?

O(log n), because it calls `_sift_down()`

5. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`?

O(1)

## Doubly Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insert_after`?

O(1)

2. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insert_before`?

O(1)

3. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.delete`?

O(1)

4. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_head`?

O(1)

5. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_head`?

O(1)

6. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_tail`?

O(1)

7. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_tail`?

O(1)

8. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_front`?

O(1)

9. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_end`?

O(1)

10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`?

O(1)

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?

O(1) is better than O(n), so the linked list generally performs this better.
